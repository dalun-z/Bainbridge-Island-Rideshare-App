## Background

### Purpose

Facilitate carpooling between residents of Bainbridge Island by providing a non-commercial platform for residents to list and find carpool opportunities. User experience will be further enhanced by matching commuters.

### Description

The Bainbridge Island Carpool project is to build a rideshare app for the residents on Bainbridge Island. The rideshare app is similar to Waze or SmartRideShare, mainly for residents who need a ride (e.g. to school, to a pub) to find other residents that have a ride to give. Client also wants the app to have a ride-hailing function for a City-sponsored shuttle.
